# Hi, I'm Peter Boshe :wave:


<img align="right" src="/images/cover_shot.png">

I am a well disciplined and enthusiastic data analyst with a just as strong background in project management and structural engineering.

I enjoy wrangling data from its rawest forms to actionable insight, models and visuals that are more comprehensible to us, humans. All in the hopes of highlighting the underlying mechanisms of what causes apparent trends in our data.

To that effect I find myself fond of topics that involve cluster analysis, network analysis, and inferential analysis that focus on causality. Would you look at that... I have a bias.

When I am not up-skilling or earning a buck, I enjoy playing pc games (currently obsessed with [splitgate](https://www.splitgate.com/) ), having a laugh, sci-fi, anime and long walks by the beach. In no particular order.
