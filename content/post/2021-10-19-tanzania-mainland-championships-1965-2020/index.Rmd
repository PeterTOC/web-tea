```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

This is a racing bar chart of the championships and the respective teams that have won over the past half century(acc. to [Data](http://www.rsssf.com/tablest/tanzchamp.html)),

Would you have guessed that less than 10 teams (only 9 teams) have won since the conception of the cup? `r emo::ji("surprised")`

## setting up the environment

```{r environment, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# clear environment 
rm(list = ls())

# setting environment 
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(gganimate)
library(lubridate)
library(gifski)
library(png)
library(knitr)

# loading data 
df <- read_excel("Tanzania mainland championships.xlsx")

```

## pre-processing

```{r pre-processing}
df2 <- df %>% 
  mutate(Cup = 1) %>% 
  complete(Team, Year) %>% 
  replace_na(list(Cup = 0)) %>%  
  group_by(Team) %>% 
  mutate(count = cumsum(Cup))
  
```

```{r}
df2 %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  arrange(Year, -count) %>% 
  #assign ranking
  mutate(rank = 1:n()) ->
ranked_by_year
```

```{r}
my_theme <- theme_classic(base_family = "Times") +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.line.y = element_blank()) +
  theme(legend.background = element_rect(fill = "gainsboro")) +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gainsboro")) +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "gainsboro"))
```

### Static Plot

```{r}
ranked_by_year %>% 
   ggplot(
  aes(xmin = 0,
      xmax = count,
      ymin = rank - .45,
      ymax = rank + .45,
      y = rank,
    fill = Team
  )
) +
  geom_rect(alpha = .7) +  
  geom_text(col = "gray13",  
            hjust = "right",  
            aes(label = Team),  
            x = -1) + 
    geom_text(aes(count + 1,
                  label = round(count)),
            color = "black",
            position = "identity",
            size = 2.5) +
  scale_y_reverse() +
  # scale_x_continuous(
  #   limits = c(-39, 27),
  #   breaks = 1:30) +
  labs(
    title = "Mainland Championships",
    x = "Cups Won",
    y = ""
  ) + 
    facet_wrap(~ Year) +
  my_theme ->
my_plot
```

## Make Gif

```{r}
my_plot +  
  facet_null() +  
  scale_x_continuous(
    limits = c(-10, 40),
    breaks = seq(0, 30, 5)) +
  geom_text(x = 30, y = -7.5,  
            family = "Times",  
            aes(label = as.character(Year)),  
            size = 20, col = "grey18") +  
  aes(group = Team) +  
  transition_time(Year) +
  enter_fade() +
  exit_fade() -> p



  animate(p, fps = 4, duration = 27, width = 800, height = 600)
  
```
