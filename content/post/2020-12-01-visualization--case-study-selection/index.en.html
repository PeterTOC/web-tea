<p>The task was to mine for relevant data and presenting them in a manner that would simplify the decision making process in picking countries as case studies.</p>
<ul>
<li>The aim of the research paper was to assess the state and level of data protection regulation in Africa in order to;
<ul>
<li>Get a deeper feel of the trends present among the countries, </li>
<li>To find out which nations are to a more degree exposed to data mishandling,</li>
<li>To find out which countries have strategies in place to safeguard their citizensâ€™ right of privacy.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
