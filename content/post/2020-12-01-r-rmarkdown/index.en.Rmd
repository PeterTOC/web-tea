The task was to mine for relevant data and presenting them in a manner that would simplify the decision making process in picking countries as case studies.


- The aim of the research paper was to assess the state and level of data protection regulation in Africa in order to;
  - Get a deeper feel of the trends present among the countries, \n
  - To find out which nations are to a more degree exposed to data mishandling,\n
  - To find out which countries have strategies in place to safeguard their citizens' right of privacy.\n
