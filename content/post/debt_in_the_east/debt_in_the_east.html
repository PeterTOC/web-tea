<h2>Our Data</h2>
<p>Our data was downloaded from the <a href="https://databank.worldbank.org/source/international-debt-statistics#">international debt statistics</a> which was last updated on the 14th of January at the time of download.</p>
<p>We have data on five countries in East Africa to Explore and compare some debt metrics from 1970-2020. The five countries are;</p>
<ul>
<li>Burundi</li>
<li>Kenya</li>
<li>Uganda</li>
<li>Rwanda</li>
<li>Tanzania</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: This Analysis is purely exploratory in nature, and correlation is not proof of causation.</p>

<h3>Current Account Balance (current US$)</h3>
<p>This introductory plot shows the trends of the <code>current account balance</code> and some major events that took place during our time period of interest. Although there might be several first-takes but mine was, <strong>“what happened in the 2000s ? and is it still happening?”</strong></p>
<p>This plot, however, does not give granular insight to trends. As one would wonder why country’s account balances took steep dives even after events like <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/prsp/prsp.aspx">SAPs transitions</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/31st_G8_summit">G8 summit in 2005</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubilee_2000">2000 Jubilee.</a></p>
<p>The <code>current account balance</code> is a result of various factors like new grants, disbursements, debt forgiveness grants, principal repayments to external debt, reserves and many more.</p>

<hr />
<p>In the following sections we will be looking at some of the factors that account to the <code>current account balance</code> sum, and we will see how they relate with some of the major events. Let’s dive right in.</p>
<hr />
<div id="debt-forgiveness-grants-current-us" class="section level4">
<h4>1. Debt forgiveness grants (current US$)</h4>
<p>We see a collective spike in debt forgiveness grants after the G8 summit (so meetings do work!), however Kenya and Burundi seem to be left out on the action. It would be interesting to know if they were withheld due to not meeting the same criteria that left Kenya out of the HIPC initiative in 1996.

<ul>
<li><p>In June <strong>2005</strong>, the Group of Eight (G8) gathering of the worlds most developed economies, resolved, through their finance ministers, to grant total debt relief to 18 countries that had reached ‘completion point’, amounting to $40 billion. Fourteen of these countries are in Africa. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10220460902986180">Foreign aid, debt relief and Africa’s development: problems and prospects. 2009.</a></p></li>
<li><p>The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other multilateral, bilateral and commercial creditors began the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in <strong>1996</strong>, However among the East African countries, Kenya does not meet the criteria to receive debt relief. Countries must make full use of traditional debt-relief mechanisms to be eligible for debt relief under the HIPC Initiative. <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/debt/brief/hipc">Brief</a> <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/hipc/cost2/index.htm">Countries must make full use of traditional debt-relief mechanisms to be eligible for debt relief under the HIPC Initiative.</a></p></li>

<h4>2. Total reserves (includes gold, current US$)</h4>
<p>For some reason, As of 2022-02-16, The world bank’s most recent info reported on Total reserves for both Tanzania and Uganda is from <strong>2018</strong>.</p>

<div id="debt-service-and-net-flows-on-external-debt-central-bank" class="section level4">
<h4>3. Debt service and Net Flows on external debt, central bank</h4>
<p>It is curious to see how the trends of <code>Debt service on external debt, central bank</code> correlated with political unrest and wars with the respective countries involved.</p>
<p>The Ugandan Bush war intrigued me as even with other charts on <code>Disbursement on external debt</code> and <code>Principal payment on external debt</code> (which are not incl. due to redundancy) show the same trends, where the <code>payment of external debt, central bank</code>, peaked during the war. Even the <code>Netflow on external debt</code> took a hard regression towards the mean to negative values. Would be interesting to learn more on this.<br />

<h4>4. Debt service and Net Flows on external debt, general government sector (PPG)</h4>
<p>Generally, the <code>debt service on external debt, general government sector (PPG)</code> has gradually been increasing as the debts pile up which is a good thing, however, we see that despite Kenya’s efforts on <code>debt service on external debt, general government sector(PPG)</code> a huge chunk of that might be attributed to the high <code>Net flows on external debt, general government sector(PPG)</code> which are the payments that go the interests as opposed to the principal payments.</p>

<div id="use-of-imf-credits" class="section level4">
<h4>6. Use of IMF credits</h4>
<p>Simply put, The IMF credits are low interest loans offered to countries in need.
We see a sudden drop in reported in 2006 which might be attributed to policy changes as we see a pick up on the SDR allocations post-2008.</p>
<p>The IMF report linked below the plot might clarify things but the technical jargon was two vocabularies away from turning my brains into mush. 🤣</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Despite several interesting findings, My main question about what happened in the 2000s has not been answered with the data at hand.</p>
<p>However, upon browsing I stumbled upon various resources that reported record high loans from our friends from the <strong>far</strong> east, China, from the year 2000. I specifically liked the dashboard on the following <a href="https://chinaafricaloandata.bu.edu">site.</a> (click on explore)</p>
<p>And with that I close this chapter with my eyes set on the public database provided by China Africa Research Initiative and Boston University Global Development Policy Center. 2021. It would be nice to explore in the near future.</p>
